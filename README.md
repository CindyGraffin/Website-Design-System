# NATURE STYLE GUIDE

## Introduction

This project was done as part of a Codecademy's project, I had to make a style guide on the theme of my choice, which was 'natural'. 

## General infos

In this project I made several sections:

* A nav bar at the top<br>
* A header with a background-image<br>
* The fisrt section with three typographies <br>
* The second section with three rows of circles, one for a blue color chart, one for a green color chart and the last for beige color chart.<br>
* The third section is about me<br>
* And finally a footer.<br>
